# 1 **WHAT IS GRIMLOCKE?**

### **1.1 ABOUT GRIMLOCKE?**

Grimlocke was formerly known as a private town (no public access) called Town of Raccoon Bay. Grimlocke started as just a place for a group of close friends and our mall featuring our stores.

Grimlocke is a family friendly community allowing both children and furries. Located in Oregon, U.S.A, Grimlocke neighbors the city of Astoria nestled along the bay and surrounded by a forest. We appear just like a regular modern family roleplay community; but under a masquerade lives supernatural and mythical beings of lore.

### **1.2 HOW IS GRIMLOCKE SET UP?**

Each region is set up to be roughly 5-7 miles apart.

Leaving Raccoon Bay and heading into Sunrise, that would easily be a 5-mile distance. Add on a couple miles to get to the other side of Sunrise (like the campground).

Leaving Raccoon Bay and heading into Juniper Woods, roughly 7 miles past the hospital/lighthouse area. Juniper would be considered a very country/rural setting.

Outside of the center of town, most homes (as on Sunrise Heights and Juniper Woods) would be spaced apart and not easily seen into, some several miles apart. Check "RP OK" signs to see how far a house sits back from the road (i.e., 42 Juniper Circle Juniper Woods, aka White Valley Ranch, the house sits nearly a mile from the road)

White Valley National Forest extends from and around Sunrise Heights past Juniper Woods. The town of Grimlocke is nestled between the Crescent Moon Bay and the National Forest.

Treat the forest as many many miles deep and not easily traversed. Best way outside of hiking would be by horse, dirt bike, or ATV.

To get to the cemetery would be at least an hour's hike from the dirt road, to get to the small house on the hill would take you a couple hours to hike from the dirt road, and to access the mountain above the cave tunnels would take a minimum of a 4 hour hike from the dirt road. Due to the steep paths and exposed roots, horseback or by foot only.

The tunnels would also be a lot deeper than they appear and take a very long time to navigate without Supernatural guidance. There would be many many tunnels both closed off and caved in - think of how normal mines are when they are closed off to the public. The tunnels are by foot only. The use of cellular devices would not be possible. Short wave radios would work until the person went deeper into the mines.

To reach the entrance of the canyon against Racoon Bay's border would be about a 45-minute drive, and not easily seen from above. The canyon itself is too narrow for vehicles to enter and must be reached on foot, bicycle, horse, etc.

#### **1.3 BUSINESSES NOT RELATED TO ROLEPLAY.**

We have a mall in the sky that holds a collaboration of stores. This mall is off-limits to emergency service roleplay (i.e., fire, shootings, etc.). This is a bother to our visitors and customers. If you are inquiring about space in the mall for a non-roleplay business: All stores must have General to Moderate rated items/pictures/ads only. If you require an area to sell or display your Adult rated items, a skybox will be provided for you. You will be responsible for routing your own teleports. For inquiries, you can open a region support ticket in our Discord.

The community exists because of this mall. This is why Sunrise Heights holds the national forest and the prims and scripted items rezzed out are heavily monitored. Light Roleplay is allowed as some like the experience of just going to a shopping plaza. You can find the landmark in our welcome center.

#### **1.4 SUPERNATURAL ROLEPLAYING**

We are a supernatural community. What does that mean? It means we are a modern community with supernatural secrets. The laws here are the same as elsewhere with strict rules on supernatural exposure laws. Humans must never find out that supernatural's exist or we could become subjects for scientists, gain the interest of various Government bodies, be used as pawns, etc.

To simplify this, think of the Harry Potter world. Magic exists but muggles remain blissfully unaware. This allows for everyone to have fun, even if supernatural roleplay isn't their style. But roleplay chat is open for all nature of roleplays that follow our covenant.

Not a fan of magic and supernatural? No problem. You would just ignore anything that might seem out of place because the human mind is an amazing thing. Remember, you are never forced to do a roleplay that you did not agree to. Supernatural's will hide their true nature, and if you do come across something out of place, you, as a human, can just pretend there is a reasonable explanation for it and carry on. See someone with wings, horns, or ashen skin - You may see them as normal humans, think they're cosplaying, or just came back from a party.

Did you stumble on a Role Play (RP) scene where there's a disembodied voice? You could hear nothing at all, hear the wind, nothing out of the ordinary.

Do you enjoy magic? You'd work hard to protect yourself and others, avoiding bringing up certain things in public or exposing yourself as a non-human. The laws are very strict for breaking this and the consequences are severe. Remember, IC actions have IC consequences.

Let's work to make this fun for everyone. We've been doing a roleplay storyline for 9 yrs following this rule and have done it in non-magic communities with no issue (by keeping our roleplays in-house and never publicly stated). If you have any questions, just ask! We're more than happy to help you settle in.

We suggest, but do not require, to wear a titler marking your race what humans could see/type of illusion, etc. This is particularly helpful for those who do not wish to be involved in supernatural roleplays or trying to interact with you. Mark yourself as human or No Supernatural roleplay.

Keep in mind, if you walk into a roleplay, people are not expected to pause or stop roleplaying until you pass. You could emote feeling a chill and a sense of unease, remember you forgot to lock your door, or just turn around and walk away.

# **2 RULES & POLICIES**

#### **2.1 GENERAL RULES**

- 1. All staff decisions are final. If you feel a decision is wrong, you are welcome to open a support ticket and have an appeal made. All decisions are in effect until an answer is given to the appeal. We follow the Three (3) strike rule. If the matter or situation has been dealt with prior, it will not be revisited after the Third (3rd) time.
- *2.* Vulgarity: We're not uber strict on this, but we do ask that you do not use strong vulgar words (i.e., slut, cunt, etc.), racial slurs, etc. You can use certain words like A\*\* or F\*\*k for emotionally charged scenes but ask that it's not repetitive. Sometimes certain things slip out, but please monitor yourself. You can easily emote */me shouted F\*\*K three times after stubbing my little toe on the coffee table.*
- 3. No bullying
- 4. No racism.
- 5. For the sake of sanity, please, avoid discussing heated real-life topics such as: religion, politics, covid, etc. These things may come up in roleplay and it's fine, just make sure you're able to dissociate your real feelings to prevent it from becoming something a member of management would need to step in on.
- 6. We do not allow covid or school violence roleplays.
- 7. No terrorist events (school shootings or school related violence with mass casualties, no mention of real-life terrorist groups or operations or roleplay around it, no bombing school or hospital [this includes the surface school office above Whalemart], no replication real life terrorist events)
- 8. We do not allow covid or pandemic level roleplays. We may have the normal flu and cold season, a supernatural ailment, or other community wide roleplays but this is done at the discretion of Grimlocke management and the Director of the Hospital.
- 9. No voice. You can use private calling, discord, or various other methods to talk to someone if you need.
- 10. Voice is turned off except on home parcels, fire department, and select areas.
- 11. All voice Role Play (RP) is voided, only exceptions under approval by management.
- 12. Please clean up after yourself. Do not keep items rezzed out that are not on your rental property with the exception of a crime or roleplay scene. Please notify a member of staff if you are leaving items out for longer than you will physically be at the scene. Rez is left on for photography and visitors to roleplay but if this becomes an issue, we will lock it to closed rez.
- 13. Please do not teleport in and out in public places when it's avoidable create landmarks off to the side of the buildings or inside a room like a restroom.
- 14. Do not go into someone's active rental without permission or following the notecards if they have a Roleplay OK sign.
- 15. No sex or sexual talk outside of your rented privacy parceled home. This applies to all businesses, Correctional and Medical facilities, cars in the forest, and any area that is not a private residence that is privacy parceled. Both the OOC and RP group chats have this applied as well. Mentioning adult/sex related activities in the chats is not appropriate in a family community. Light PG references alluding are typical.

- 16. IC actions have IC consequences. Do a crime, be prepared to go to jail. There is no such thing as a perfect crime, you will eventually be caught.
- 17. You will not be placed in jail longer than 7 RL days. If you find yourself still in jail or it's been longer than 2 weeks since arrest and trial - please contact the Sheriff or a member of staff.
- 18. You may be released from jail with parole or probation depending on crime.
- 19. Your character will maintain their criminal record.

### **2.2 CRIMINAL ROLEPLAY**

You are required to leave a crime box detailing what would be seen/found. You are welcome to set it up as a scavenger hunt and have it investigated. But a crime box must be left. You can get a crime marker from the welcome center.

Characters cannot "NPC" check-out of the hospital or jail after a roleplay where they were In Character (IC) placed. This requires interaction with the appropriate agency. If you are finding yourself unable to roleplay this, one of our moderators will help you fade to black. This does not apply if you were transported to the hospital and no medical was available. In that case, it's an automatic fade to black and you're free to go. However, if you choose to be admitted and no one is online, you can check in via Discord.

#### **2.3 VOIDING ROLEPLAY POLICY**

This is generally disapproved of as it affects multiple people. If you've laid a scene and it's been investigated or if you've done a roleplay that involves more than just you – you will need management approval to void. The only firm denial for voiding roleplays would be trying to get out of the roleplay consequences. You do an action; you accept the reaction. Criminal Roleplays are rarely avoided – be cautious when laying the scene.

### **2.4 MIMIC ROLEPLAY POLICY**

Mimicking is the best form of flattery, but this is discouraged as this tends to burn out emergency services and others who are pulled into it. If group 1 has a kidnapping happen, group 2 should not be having a near identical roleplay either during or right after. It's advised you wait a few days before starting your own arc out of respect for the emergency service staff. You are welcome to reach out and ask if you want to do it at the same time and verify there is manpower to handle it.

#### **2.5 EMERGENCY SERVICES ROLEPLAY POLICY**

We heavily discourage repeating the same roleplay on repeat (example back to back runaways) in close succession. We have a 2-week cooldown between heavy style roleplays that involve police or other emergency services to prevent burnout on our small departments.

Before setting a fire or needing immediate emergency services, please verify in OOC group chat we have active duty available.

Just because someone is online does not mean they are actively on duty.

If you want to leave an offline 911 to point towards a crime scene marker - you can use the #iccommunications channel in our discord, tag as a 911 call. You can emote in the RP Chat that you've called 911, spoke to someone, and the relay will handle the rest (in that call, please provide all the information for the call, if you're doing it in Discord, please tag the Sheriff's).

If you notice there is an active roleplay using utility resources (fire, sheriff, medical), message one of the resource role-player's before starting another roleplay.

All emergency calls and roleplay chatter is in the roleplay group only. The OOC group is for out of character chatting or roleplay discussion.

### **2.6 FIRE ROLEPLAY**

The following rules apply to all fire roleplays

- 1. We only support HD fire
- 2. Max 4 fires with 2 child or 2 fires with 3 child. Please only set the fire to the type of burn it is (i.e., kitchen fire would require foam not water. Forest fire would require water.) This is to keep the sim lag down.
- 3. There can not be more than 1 fire roleplay at a time, any that happen after the first roleplay is activated will be voided immediately.
  - a. Unless Prior approval given from fire chief of member of management.

## **2.7 CLOTHING AND ATTACHMENT**

- 1. Chest (women) and pelvis must be covered at all times with bits and bobs removed when possible.
- 2. Child avatars must be fully clothed at all times. We're aware real-life toddlers run around in their diapers most of the time, but this is a game not real life.
- 3. As per Linden Labs TOS, all child avatars (under 18 years old) must wear BOM undergarment(s) [female appearing or gender fluid in a female appearing body must have a BoM top] at all times as well.
- 4. Slappers or other similar attachments (that represent bedroom style behavior) that speak in local chat are to be removed as they are disruptive to roleplay, and some people tend to troll avatars who wear them.

## **2.8 AREAS AND EVENTS MARKED SPN**

- 1. All areas marked as SPN are considered to be Supernatural only.
- 2. If you are a human and you go into an area marked as a SPN location or to an event that's advertised as SPN, you are agreeing to supernatural roleplay.

# **2.9 18+ EVENTS**

- 1. No minor (17 and below) aged avatars.
- 2. You are not allowed to attend or "accidentally" stumble into an area where this is happening.
- 3. No 18+ event shall include any explicit roleplay.

### **2.10 ROLEPLAY CHAT**

- 1. It is heavily encouraged to take your roleplay to local when everyone is within 19 meter distance from each other.
- 2. If there is no activity in Roleplay chat you are free to use it for your stage but follow a post order if someone else posts and keep your posts limited to one every several minutes.
- 3. Use Roleplay Chat to let others know where you'll be at to encourage roleplay but do not use it to say you're going to a location and not show up.

## **2.11 GHOST EMOTING**

Ghost emoting (emoting you are somewhere that you are not physically at) is prohibited without permission from those it affects. (i.e., Jane is going to Whalemart. Billy is elsewhere on the grid or using the relay and says he's at Whalemart and tries to interact with Jane's character by emoting in a way that forces Jane to respond. This causes disruption and is unfair to the person physically there. Always seek permission before ghost emoting and accept a denial with grace.)

### **2.12 VEHICLES AND DRIVING**

- 1. If you drive, you are roleplaying, with minor exceptions. You break the law; you serve your sentence. Failure to do so will result in loss of your Role Play (RP) privilege and can result in a temp ban.
- 2. All vehicles left out for 24 hours will be returned. If a vehicle is left for a specific roleplay, management needs to be notified to avoid having it returned. Vehicles owned by a resident with an existing mailbox will not be returned (This is subject to management's discretion). In Character wise, the vehicle will be ticketed and towed.
- 3. No Vehicles over 50 prims (without approval).
- 4. License Plates/Driver's Licenses/ID there are forms for you to fill out here: <https://townofgrimlocke.com/dmv> The fee is \$15L for a generic plate & \$30L for custom plates, to be paid at the time of delivery. Need a fake ID/license? Yup, we do that too. Take the risk of being caught without a license (we will accept valid licenses and registrations from other communities) and the police may catch you.
- 5. Paying fines this is Role Play (RP) only. If you do not want to Role Play (RP) with the police/court in paying it, just do a simple emote in the Role Play (RP) group that your fine has been paid (mailed in, paid online, stopped by the village hall, etc.). Post it in the discord server or send a copy of it to the Sheriff or Majors.
- 6. Vehicles approaching a road blocked due to a roleplay should DM someone involved as a courtesy before going around it. This is to prevent someone uninvolved with the roleplay from being stuck in place. If it is a checkpoint or construction, you'll be moving soon enough.
- 7. Vehicles are in character and are open to things like theft Role Play (RP) if unlocked. This also applies to properties with the "RP OK" sign. Check your vehicle settings and lock your vehicle if you do not want it stolen.

#### **2.13 SZYM PALADINS**

- 1. We are allowing Paladins to max out at 75 prims and the truck must be optimized.
- 2. No more than 1 Paladin per avatar. We will take into consideration for service departments to allow an increase of prims and to allow more than 1 rezzed, (i.e. to allow a personal and a work truck, on an individual basis.) However, the only people in departments that should be driving vehicles home are police and fire chiefs and assistant chiefs, and the head of DoT.

### **2.14 SCRIPTED ITEMS**

- 1. Furniture pertaining to The Sims' style huds (BeYou, Life, Life2, Xeolife, Mystory, etc.) is limited to 3 Hud specific furniture Items/appliances per rental. More will result in you being contacted and asked to pick up the items, or them being returned if you fail to do so. The ONLY exception to this is the Caring You Hud and products. This is a very low lag and community wide supported Hud.
- 2. For systems like BeYou and DFS we allow 2 crop plots per rental, and 4 animals (Caring You we allow up to 6).
- 3. We do not allow more than 3 breedable animals per rental. This can be adjusted with approval of management.
- 4. You are allowed up to 5 NPC's (i.e. babies, pets) per rental. If you notice sounds are carrying off of your parcel – please immediately notify management to get this corrected.
- 5. If you rent a plot that is not parceled, you are not permitted to have one of these out that makes sounds when offline. If you are able to mute them, they can remain.
- 6. If you are on a region that has the aesthetics (Horses/Non Breedable Large Animals) to have a farm, this is approved. For the regions that would not support it, we offer stable rentals.
- 7. Private rentals, you may have up to 4 horses, in the event you have NPCs, you are allowed a total of 9 items to be out, which is a combination of NPC and Large Animals. You do not need to count animals that are descripted or static (you do count them for prims, but they are not counted as an NPC).

## **2.15 ROLEPLAY STYLE**

Grimlocke dose not support the usage of roleplaying with health meters. Any roleplay involving them will be voided, and any issues raised from them will be closed without investigation and all parties involved will be warned.

We follow a 3-line attack rule & strongly advise the use of dice if it is a fight. See the Example below.

- ➢ Sasemi: Sas pulls a throwing dagger off her hip and twirls it in her fingers as she stares at the man threatening her.
- ➢ Roger: Roger eyes up the dagger and subtly reaches into his pocket to pull out his switchblade with the thumb trigger.
- ➢ Sasemi: Sas deftly twirls the dagger and throws it.

That attack was done in 3 lines. At this point, Roger has the call to make if the dagger hits him in some way. This being said, you cannot avoid every attack. Even if your character is a Samurai (Sasemi) and highly trained, she would not be able to avoid every attack. Same with someone in a gunfight. Choose these battles carefully and discuss with your Role Play (RP) partners the course of action you wish or don't wish to take. We do not support perma-deaths here (but it is up to the owner of the character how to handle it). If you are fatally shot, you have the option to have it Role Played (RP) as medical saving your life, AKA fade to black. If you choose to die, it would be a name change and a new character.

## **2.16 DICE ROLLS**

Dice Rolls - We offer a dice Hud in the visitor welcome basket located in the welcome center. This is suggested to be used to gauge your attacks and their hits.

Dice numbers are as follows:

- 1. 1-4 barely hit opponent / easily avoided
- 2. 5-7 hit of some sort / it's going to sting, possible bleeding, light bruising
- 3. 8-9 land a hard hit on the opponent / you would have a hard time running off. Your leg, arm, etc. would be heavily damaged and unusable
- 4. 10-12 your attack succeeds as you intended in the emote given / close to unconsciousness and unable to avoid the attack at all or your hit is head on.

## **2.17 BANS**

All Bans are held a minimum of 30 days. After 30 days, you have the right to appeal.

You have the right to appeal a ban by contacting a Community Manager: Glitch Vidarr (fasniper), Gracie Mackenzie (GracelynnDavis), Tyler M Davis (TylerMDavis), Viktoriya Hui-Lycheborne (ILIKEPIEPIEPIEPIEPIEPIEPIEPIEPI).

# **3 SUPERNATURAL**

## **3.1 SUPERNATURAL ROLEPLAY**

Your character must be balanced and not be overpowered to the point of making it unfair to those you are roleplaying with. We do have guides for every race to follow upon request but do not push this. This is subject to change if we run into issues.

The use of magic huds are not allowed without permission. These tend to drop objects that do not always clean up, create lag, and have the chance of affecting people not involved in your roleplays. They can also lead to the mistake of you being considered a griefer. You MUST gain approval before using these or risk being banned. If you break the no exposure law, you will be subject to punishment.

You are free to roleplay supernatural activities in the roleplay group. We just ask that you respect if the person who happens into you does not wish to do supernatural roleplay and has not been involved with your roleplay. You are not required to stop or pause your existing roleplay but don't try to force someone to roleplay.

### **3.2 SUPERNATURAL AREAS**

We have specific areas set up for supernatural's to let their fangs drop, wings pop out, and claws to stretch - free to be themselves without fear of exposure. See below.

### **a. Sunrise Heights:**

- a. Brentmont Mine This is what supernatural's call the old Dwarven Mine. ICly, it's closed to the public for safety reasons and boarded up. Humans may be on the "upper" area of the mining tunnels, but the "lower" tunnels would be hard for them to navigate. (TLDR: The surface of the region would be considered the upper area as there is a landslide area hiding a cave. The Lower areas would be the tunnel system in the sky, accessed via teleporter).
- b. Ironside (Dwarven Bar) Hidden bar deep in the Dwarven Mine. (located via teleporter, tunnels in the sky)
- c. Mount Coterie Vampire Lounge. An area that operates as a blood bar and resting place for vampires. (located within a lower cavern on top of the mountain - you can cam into it from the main cave entrance)

### **b. Raccoon Bay:**

- a. The Ravens Knock Occult Shop selling reagents and other oddities. Humans see it as a curiosity shop, but Supernatural's know it as a place to get whatever they need.
- b. The Holistic Witch white witch shop and hang out location. Healing vibes and energy, safe area that's warded to prevent humans from overhearing conversations inside.
- c. Shifting Kelp Shoals Mer grotto containing everything Mer related from playground, homes, restaurant, shop, and meeting areas.
- d. Healing Leaf Tea Shop & Apothecary Upstairs, invite only, is a safe area for Supernatural's to have magic infused teas and natural remedies created for them.
- e. Grimlocke Public Library the unassuming library offers Sanctuary in its attic to all Supernatural's. The magic that protects the Sanctuary prevents people from being directly ordered out, auras from being sensed, or sounds like talking or footsteps from being heard. The basement offers a full collection of Supernatural related books from histories, family lineages, medical, ancient scrolls, spell casting - anything relating to a Supernatural that the Librarian has been able to get her hand son.

f. Elvina Territory - pack grounds for the Elvina pack are located on this region. Offering pack protection in an all-inclusive Supernatural commune/pack where anyone who is either a Supernatural or affiliated with the Supernatural world can become part of the pack. Those interested would make inquiries at Murphy's Pub.

#### **c. Juniper Woods:**

- a. Juniper Territory pack grounds for the Juniper pack are located in this area. Offering pack protection in an all-inclusive Supernatural commune/pack where anyone who is either a Supernatural or affiliated with the Supernatural world can become part of the pack. Those interested would make inquiries at the White Valley Vineyard.
- b. White Valley Medical Center offers medical to Supernatural's for any and all ailments and successfully is able to hide and offer Sanctuary to all in need within the limitations set by the Medical Director.

# **4 CHILD AVATARS**

### **4.1 ROLEPLAY DECORUM**

- Note your age. A toddler would not be stealing a car or living on their own. A baby would not survive being outdoors alone. If you're just exploring the community, please wear an OOC (out of character) tag.
- If you are under the age of 6, you would have a responsible companion. You can just emote having a sitter or adult/teen with you. This caregiver would prevent you from most criminal activities: stealing a car, breaking into a store, etc.; and act in the best interest of the child. That being said, of course some children may find themselves without a guardian. If any crimes are committed, you are expected to roleplay out the consequences and accept that you may be placed in the care of CPS or placed in our juvenile detention center.
- Heavy roleplay scenes child avatars may be asked in DMs to leave an area before IC seeing something. A good example of this would be a gory crime scene. The officers would not have the ability to handle a child on top of the investigation for the scene. Otherwise, an NPC'd officer would intercept you and move you along.
- Modesty Layers All female appearing children regardless of age are required to have a BoM top on that covers the chest area (this applies to Mer as well. We want to see either a bodysuit style or tank top - not just shells).

### **4.2 MEDICAL ROLEPLAY**

- 1. All children will have a happy ending. No minor aged avatar will be killed or permanently injured. This is done out of respect for those who do real life medical.
- 2. Recovery period will be up to the medical and child role player and not to exceed an unreasonable amount of time. Unless both parties have agreed, no one should be held longer than 7 RL days.
- 3. Please ensure that all parties are comfortable with the nature of roleplay.

# **4.3 TEEN/MINOR AGED CRIMINALS**

- 1. Child avatars under the age of 13 should not be committing major crimes such as grand theft auto, robbery, and arson. Common sense logic applies; Stealing your parent's car at age 12 is reasonable, setting buildings on fire and lockpicking and stealing other people's cars at age 8-12 are not. Capital crimes like attempted murder and murder should not be committed by any child avatar under age 16.
  - a. There are always exceptions to rules. Accidental fires, an in-depth character who is willing to accept roleplay consequence, a storyline that has led to a certain roleplay plot. If you are uncertain, you're always welcome to reach out.
  - b. Please note juvie is for all minor aged characters. Just because you are a single digit age will not prevent you from being placed behind bars.
- 2. You will not be held longer than 7 days in Juvie unless this is agreed on by yourself and with the Sheriff's consent. If you find yourself still in Juvie or still awaiting a trial - please contact the Sheriff or a member of staff.

## **4.4 JUVENILE DETENTION FOR CRIMINAL YOUTH**

- 1. The Juvenile Detention Center is for criminal youth who are serving out their sentences and awaiting sentencing.
- 2. There would be visiting hours between the hours of 10am and 6pm. All visitors are subject to be searched and would only be allowed access to the visitor receiving area. All visitors would have to be pre-authorized by staff at either the Sheriff's Office or the Court system.
- 3. You would need a keycode, ID Badge, or Keyfob to be let into and out of the building, with the exception of a fire alarm that would automatically unlock all doors.
- 4. All interior doors would be secure and locked.
- 5. All juveniles are given free access to the common areas. Interior doors would be monitored by a member of staff at all times and kept locked.
- 6. You would more than likely have some form of community service when freed from the Center.

- 7. You are allowed up to 15 prims for personal effects in your cell. These would be items such as religious symbols, photos, school related, books, bed decor, etc. You would not have electronics beyond a basic radio.
- 8. Your cell would be searched randomly. IC you would not have much privacy.
- 9. You can only be held in juvenile detention for a week, 7 real life days max, unless you agree to a longer sentencing. If you find your case hasn't been closed or you haven't been given your court date – please contact management.
- 10. School for juveniles currently incarcerated with in the Juvenile detention center. The Juvenile would be given the option to attend virtually via a laptop that would be restricted and monitored at all times. The Juveniles that elect to attend in person would be fitted with an ankle monitor that would track the location of the individual and would be escorted to their locker and/or classroom by a staff member from the facility and, would be picked up at the end of the school day and returned to the youth facility to continue serving their sentence.

# **5 RENTALS**

#### **5.1 RENTAL BASICS**

- 1) Rented homes are marked with mailboxes either near the front door or fence gates. These may not be mailboxes if the aesthetics may call for something else. It could be a bird feeder near the gate, a light above the door of a business.
- 2) If the meter box is locked or there is no floating text it is a rented home. This means you **cannot** enter without permission, set fire to the home, etc. If you want to Role Play (RP) breaking into a home or being an arsonist/graffiti artist, contact the renter prior for approval. The only exception to this rule would be if they have the Role Play (RP) OK sign with a notecard detailing permission.
- 3) Roleplay Notification We will provide 2 signs of which one is to be placed near the front of your property. These will be "**RP OK**" and "**NO RP.**"
  - a. You will need to dictate via a dropped notecard in the roleplay allowed sign if you are willing to have your home open to roleplay and what your limits are (i.e., break ins allowed, no break ins when offline, what security measures you have around the property).
    - i. If you state you have cameras, there needs to be at least 1 camera visible.
    - ii. You do not need to have physical NPC, but you do need to write where they would be at and if they'd be patrolling.
      - 1. This is also within reason:
        - a. A townhouse is not going to have patrolling guards or staff, but you might have a house cleaner.

- b. A larger home or one of the country homes that may sit on a large amount of land may have patrols/guards/etc. These would need to be stated.
- c. You should also be stating at least 1 opening if you're allowing Role Play (RP) to happen on your property when you are not online.
- d. I.E, when the guards change shifts, there's a 15 min window.
- e. I.E, cook stays in the kitchen from 9am-4pm and leaves, the butler is in the house from 6am until 9pm.
- 4) Rented Properties
  - a. Anyone who has things rezzed out must be on your mailbox. When we do prim audits, things not owned by someone on your mailbox will be returned.
  - b. We may also ask you to reduce the script usage if your parcel is generating lag to your neighbors or to the region as a whole.
- 5) Parceling Rented Homes

# **7 PRIVACY**

#### **7.1 PRIVACY EXPECTATION**

Everyone has a right to privacy. This means camming is highly discouraged into rented homes. Don't want to see a photo or a BDSM cross? Don't look into the person's home. This is their personal space they are renting and not open for negotiation or judgment by others. No one should be camming into a home, taking pictures, and sharing it around as a joke or 'concerned.' If you're truly concerned about something, contact a general manager or the rental manager with your concerns. Fair warning, if we are unable to see what the issue is from the sidewalks/is not visible from outside the home – there is nothing we can do unless it breaks LL ToS. If it breaks LL ToS, then it will be reported to LL, and they will make a decision on it. We reserve the right to report and ban/evict/handle issue ourselves.
